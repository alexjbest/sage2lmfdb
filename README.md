# sage2lmfdb

This is a prototype for an interface from sage to the LMFDB.
This was written during the Sage Days 87 workshop at the University of Vermont,
and the best introduction is a demo.

See https://gist.github.com/davidlowryduda/deb1f88cc60b6e1243df8dd8f4601cde or
http://davidlowryduda.com/sage-days-87-demo-interfacing-between-sage-and-the-lmfdb/
to see an ipython notebook with example usage.

This is a work in progress, and is pre-alpha. I am actively seeking any
comments, suggestions, or requests to better set up this interface in later
stages.
